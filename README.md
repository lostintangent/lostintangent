# Hi! I'm JC 👋

I'm a PM at Microsoft, and have spent the last 15 years working on developer tools and platforms (e.g. Visual Studio, ASP.NET, browser tools for IE). I'm extremely passionate about developer productivity and collaboration, and in particular, helping to make it easier to contribute to projects, share ideas amongst your teams and the community, and embrace distributed

## 🏢 Stuff I Work On During The Week

- [Codespaces]

- [Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls)

- [IntelliCode]

## 🏝️Stuff I Build On Weekends

I love [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and in particular, it's extensibility ecosystem. As a result, I work on a few extensions that allow me to explore new ideas in developer collaboration and knowledge sharing:

- [GistPad](https://aka.ms/gistpad) - Create and edit GitHub Gists and repos, directly from the editor, and without needing to clone anything. I think of GitHub as the universal developer storage, and so GistPad is trying to provide a remotely editable client 👍

- [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) - Record and playback guided tutorials for your codebases. It's like a table-of-contents for a project, and helps walk team members through a codebase, directly from the comfort of their editor.

- [GitDoc](https://aka.ms/gitdoc)
