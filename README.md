# Hi! I'm JC ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PM at Microsoft, and have spent the last 15 years working on developer tools and platforms (e.g. Visual Studio, ASP.NET, browser tools for IE). I'm extremely passionate about developer productivity and collaboration, and in particular, helping to make it easier to contribute to projects and share ideas amongst your teams and the community.
