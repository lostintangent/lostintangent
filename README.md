# Hi! I'm JC üëã

I'm a PM at Microsoft, and have had the priviledge of working on a bunch of developer tools and services over the last 15 years (e.g. Visual Studio, ASP.NET, browser tools for IE, CodePush). I'm extremely passionate about developer productivity and collaboration, and in particular, helping to make it easier to contribute to projects, share ideas amongst your teams and the community, and supporting remote-first cultures.

## üè¢ Stuff I Work On During The Week

- [Codespaces](https://aka.ms/vscs) - Spin up a new developer environment for any GitHub repo, and be up-and-running in seconds, without needing to setup anything. Readmes, and "works on my machine" are a thing of the past!

- [Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls) - Collaboratively edit and debug in real-time, without needing to leave your editor. Keep your personalized editor setup, and pair program in a way that's actually [enjoyable](https://aka.ms/vsls-modality).

- [IntelliCode](https://aka.ms/vsintellicode) - AI-assisted development, that uses the wisdom of the GitHub community to make every part of the IDE more intelligent and assistive. Technology is changing at an insane rate, and your tools should be there to help you on that journey!

## üèùÔ∏è Stuff I Build On Weekends

I love [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and in particular, it's extensibility ecosystem. As a result, I work on a few extensions that allow me to explore new ideas in developer collaboration and knowledge sharing:

- [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) - Record and playback guided tutorials for codebases. It's like a table-of-contents for projects, and helps walk developers members through a codebase, directly from the comfort of their editor.

- [GistPad](https://aka.ms/gistpad) - Create and edit GitHub Gists and repos, directly from the editor, and without needing to clone anything. I think of GitHub as the universal developer storage, and so GistPad is trying to provide a remotely editable client, so that it's easier to edit and access your knowledge üëç

- [CodeSwing](https://aka.ms/codeswing) - A fun and interactive coding environment for building web applications snippets (aka "swings").

- [GitDoc](https://aka.ms/gitdoc) - Edit a local Git repo like a multi-file, versioned document. Auto-commit your changes, easily manage history, and keep your changes in sync, without needing to care about the Git CLI at all!

- [FlashCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.flashcode) - Create and review developer-oriented flash card decks, directly within VS Code.
