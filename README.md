# Hi! I'm JC üëã

I work at GitHub and like to explore the future of software. Between GitHub and Microsoft (where I previously worked), I've had a chance to build some fun stuff over the last 18 years (e.g. Codespaces, Github Spark, IntelliCode, Visual Studio, Live Share, ASP.NET, browser tools for IE, CodePush).

I also love [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), and in particular, it's extensibility ecosystem. As a result, I work on a few extensions that allow me to optmiize my personal workflow, and noodle on ideas in developer collaboration/knowledge sharing:

- [GistPad](https://aka.ms/gistpad) - Create and edit GitHub Gists and repos, directly from the editor, and without needing to clone anything. I think of GitHub as the universal developer storage, and so GistPad is trying to provide a remotely editable client, so that it's easier to edit and access your knowledge üëç
  
- [CodeTour](https://aka.ms/codetour) - Record and playback guided tutorials for codebases. It's like a table-of-contents for projects, and helps walk developers through a codebase, directly from the comfort of their editor.

- [CodeSwing](https://aka.ms/codeswing) - A fun and interactive coding environment for building web applications snippets (aka "swings").

- [GitDoc](https://aka.ms/gitdoc) - Edit a local Git repo like a multi-file, versioned document. Auto-commit your changes, easily manage history, and keep your changes in sync, without needing to care about the Git CLI at all!
